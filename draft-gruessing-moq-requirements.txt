1.  Introduction

   Protocol developers have been considering the implications of the
   QUIC protocol ([RFC9000]) on media transport for several years, but
   the initial focus on QUIC in the IETF was to support web applications
   that used the HTTP/3 protocol [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-http].  The
   completion of the initial versions of the QUIC specifications, and
   the adoption of [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-datagram], have cleared the way
   for proposals to use QUIC as a media transport.  This document
   examines proposals that were presented in side meetings at IETF 111,
   and analyzes them to understand requirements for media over QUIC.

2.  Prior and Existing Specifications

   Several existing draft specifications and protocols already exist
   which base their implementation around using existing protocols on
   top of QUIC, or define their own.  With the exception of RUSH, it is
   unknown if the other specifications have had any deployments or
   interop with multiple implementations.

2.1.  QRT: QUIC RTP Tunnelling

   [I-D.draft-hurst-quic-rtp-tunnelling]

   QRT encapsulates RTP and RTCP and define the means of using QUIC
   datagrams with them, defining a new payload within a datagram frame
   which distinguishes packets for a RTP packet flow vs RTCP.

2.2.  RTP over QUIC

   [I-D.draft-engelbart-rtp-over-quic]

   This specification also encapsulates RTP and RTCP but unlike QRT
   which simply relies on the default QUIC congestion control
   mechanisms, it defines a set of requirements around QUIC
   implementation's congestion controller to permit the use of separate
   control algorithms.

2.3.  RUSH - Reliable (unreliable) streaming protocol

   [I-D.draft-kpugin-rush]

   RUSH uses its own frame types on top of QUIC as it pre-dates the
   datagram specification; in addition individual media frames are given
   their own stream identifiers to remove HoL blocking from processing
   out-of-order.

   It defines its own registry for signalling codec information with
   room for future expansion but presently is limited to a subset of
   popular video and audio codecs and doesn't include other types (such
   as subtitles, transcriptions, or other signalling information) out of
   bitstream.

2.4.  Tunnelling SRT over QUIC

   [I-D.draft-sharabayko-srt-over-quic]

   Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) ([I-D.draft-sharabayko-srt]) itself
   is a general purpose transport protocol primarily for contribution
   transport use cases and this specification covers the encapsulation
   and delivery of SRT on top of QUIC using datagram frame types.  This
   specification sets some requirements regarding how the two interact
   and leaves considerations for congestion control and pacing to
   prevent conflict between the two protocols.

2.5.  Comparison of Existing Specifications

   *  Both QRT and the Engelbart draft attempt to use existing payloads
      of RTP, RTCP, and SDP unlike RUSH and SRT, as well as using
      existing Datagram frames
   *  RUSH introduces new frame types as its development pre-dates
      Datagram frames
   *  Both QRT and RUSH specify ALPN identification; the Engelbart and
      SRT drafts do not.
   *  All drafts take differing approaches to flow/stream identification
      and management; some address congestion control and others just
      omit the subject and leave it to QUIC to handle

   *Editor Note:* TODO: Present our comparison in table format.  This is
   only a start.

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Use Cases From [I-D.draft-rtpfolks-quic-rtp-over-quic]

   An early draft in the "media over QUIC" space,
   [I-D.draft-rtpfolks-quic-rtp-over-quic], defined several key use
   cases.  The following sections are taken from that draft, with
   minimal editing.

3.1.1.  Interactive peer-to-peer applications

   Interactive peer-to-peer applications, such as telephony or video
   conferencing.  Such applications operate in a trapezoid topology
   using a client-server signalling channel running SIP or WebRTC, and
   an associated peer-to-peer media path and/or data channel.  Mappings
   of SIP and WebRTC onto QUIC are possible, but outside the scope of
   this memo.  It might be desirable to transport the peer-to-peer RTP
   media path and data channel using QUIC, to leverage QUIC's security,
   stream demultiplexing, and congestion control features running over a
   single UDP port.  This would simplify media demultiplexing, and
   potentially obviate the need for the congestion control work being
   done in the RMCAT working group.  The design of QUIC makes it
   difficult however, since QUIC does not support peer-to-peer NAT
   traversal using STUN and ICE (and indeed uses a packet format that
   conflicts with STUN).  These applications require low latency
   congestion control, and would benefit from unreliable delivery modes.

3.1.2.  Interactive client-server applications

   Interactive client-server applications.  For example, a "click here
   to speak to a representative" button on a website that starts an
   interactive WebRTC call.  Such applications avoid the NAT traversal
   issues that complicate peer-to-peer use of QUIC, and can benefit from
   stream demultiplexing and (if appropriate algorithms are provided)
   congestion control.  They would benefit from unreliable delivery
   modes to reduce latency.

3.1.3.  Client-server video on demand applications using WebRTC or RTSP

   Client-server video on demand applications using WebRTC or RTSP.
   These benefit from QUIC stream demultiplexing in the same way as
   interactive client-server applications, but with relaxed latency
   bounds that make them fit better with existing congestion control
   algorithms and reliable delivery.

3.1.4.  Live video streaming from a server

   Live video streaming from a server can also benefit from stream
   demultiplexing.  If designed carefully, it should be easier to
   gateway RTP over QUIC into multicast RTP for scalable delivery than
   to gateway HTTP adaptive video over QUIC into multicast.

3.2.  Suggested Use Cases for "Media Over QUIC" Going Forward

   The use cases that are most applicable today given the existing and
   known future capabilities of QUIC are included in this section.

   *Editor Note:* this section is a work in progress, and is based on
   the opinions of the draft authors.  We are happy to be guided by
   discussion about other use cases.

3.2.1.  Unidirectional live stream contribution

   Unidirectional live stream contribution.  Two immediate scenarios
   that best describe this is firstly users on a streaming platform in a
   remote scenario from their phone live streaming an event or going on
   to an audience in real time in relatively low bitrates (~1-5Mbit).
   The second scenario is larger bitrate contribution feeds in
   broadcast.  This can be an OB feed "back to base" into playout
   gallery, or from playout facilities to online distribution platforms.

3.2.2.  2.  Distribution from platform to audience

   Distribution from platform to audience.  Whilst use of WebRTC or RTSP
   today for On-Demand media streaming is not typical with adaptive
   streaming like HLS and DASH being predominantly used as WebRTC is
   more applicable in latency sensitive contexts such as live sporting
   events.  Instead use cases where there is live streaming of TV linear
   output, or live streaming such as Twitch or Facebook, or non-UGC
   services like OTT offerings made by broadcasters.

4.  Requirements

   This section lists requirements for providing real time media
   streaming over a QUIC connection.

4.1.  Codec Agility

   When initiating a media session, both the sender and receiver should
   be able to negotiate the codecs, bitrates and other media details
   based on capabilities and preferences.

4.2.  Support a range of Latencies

   TODO: confirm requirements for latency

   [I-D.draft-ietf-mops-streaming-opcons] describes these latency
   requirements for streaming media.

   *  ultra low-latency (less than 1 second)
   *  low-latency live (less than 10 seconds)
   *  non-low-latency live (10 seconds to a few minutes)
   *  on-demand (hours or more)

4.3.  Congestion Control

   TODO: Confirm these requirements, consider looking at how RFC 8836
   applies to this requirement.

4.4.  Support Lossless and Lossy Media Transport

   TODO: confirm scope of this draft to describe lossless media
   transport, lossy media transport, or both lossless and lossy
   transport.

4.5.  Flow Directionality

   Media should be able to flow in either direction from client to
   server or vice-versa, either individually or concurrently.

4.6.  WebTransport

   TODO: Unsure if this should be a requirement.  If it is, we have to
   consider two things: WebTransport supports HTTP/2, are we going to
   explicitly exclude it?  Also, WebTransport
   [I-D.draft-ietf-webtrans-overview] has normative language around
   congestion control which may be at odds with our potential
   requirements.

4.7.  Authentication

   The protocol SHOULD have capabilities beyond what QUIC provides to
   allow hosts to authenticate one another, this should be kept simple
   but robust in nature to prevent attacks like credential brute-
   forcing.

   TODO: More details are required here

5.  Non-requirements

   This section covers topics that are explicitly out of scope for the
   time being.

5.1.  NAT Traversal

   From Section 8.2 of [RFC9000]:

      Path validation is not designed as a NAT traversal mechanism.
      Though the mechanism described here might be effective for the
      creation of NAT bindings that support NAT traversal, the
      expectation is that one endpoint is able to receive packets
      without first having sent a packet on that path.  Effective NAT
      traversal needs additional synchronization mechanisms that are not
      provided here.

   Although there are use cases that would benefit from a mechanism for
   NAT traversal, a QUIC protocol extention would be required to support
   those use cases today.

5.2.  Media Transport Protocols

   The creation of new media transport protocols should be avoided, and
   instead we should make use of RTP [RFC3550] and the existing
   ecosystem of payload formats and methods of signalling where
   possible.  It may transpire a need to extend these specificiations;
   in which case we should work with the relevant working groups and
   present our use-cases.

5.3.  Multicast

   Even if multicast and other network broadcasting capabilities are
   used in delivering media in our use cases, as QUIC doesn't yet
   support it and it's inclusion would require a lot more complexity in
   both the specification and client implimentation this should be left
   out for now.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   As this document is intended to create discussion and consensus and
   introduces no security considerations of its own.
