1.  Introduction

2.  Prior and Existing Specifications

   Several existing draft specifications and protocols already exist
   which base their implementation around using existing protocols on
   top of QUIC, or define their own.  With the exception of RUSH, it is
   unknown if the other specifications have had any deployments or
   interop with multiple implementations.

2.1.  draft-hurst-quic-rtp-tunnelling

   QRT encapsulates RTP and RTCP and define the means of using QUIC
   datagrams with them, defining a new payload within a datagram frame
   which distinguishes packets for a RTP packet flow vs RTCP.

2.2.  draft-engelbart-rtp-over-quic

   This specification also encapsulates RTP and RTCP but unlike QRT
   which simply relies on the default QUIC congestion control
   mechanisms, it defines a set of requirements around QUIC
   implementation's congestion controller to permit the use of separate
   control algorithms.

2.3.  draft-kpugin-rush

   RUSH uses its own frame types on top of QUIC as it pre-dates the
   datagram specification; in addition individual media frames are given
   their own stream identifiers to remove HoL blocking from processing
   out-of-order.

   It defines its own registry for signalling codec information with
   room for future expansion but presently is limited to a subset of
   popular video and audio codecs and doesn't include other types (such
   as subtitles, transcriptions, or other signalling information) out of
   bitstream.

2.4.  draft-sharabayko-srt-over-quic

   SRT [I-D.draft-sharabayko-srt] itself is a general purpose transport
   protocol primarily for contribution transport use cases and this
   specification covers the encapsulation and delivery of SRT on top of
   QUIC using datagram frame types.  This specification sets some
   requirements regarding how the two interact and leaves considerations
   for congestion control and pacing to prevent conflict between the two
   protocols.

2.5.  Comparison of Existing Specifications

   *  Both QRT and the Engelbart draft attempt to use existing payloads
      of RTP, RTCP, and SDP unlike RUSH and SRT, as well as using
      existing Datagram frames
   *  RUSH introduces new frame types as its development pre-dates
      Datagram frames
   *  Both QRT and RUSH specify ALPN identification; the Engelbart and
      SRT drafts do not.
   *  All drafts take differing approaches to flow/stream identification
      and management; some address congestion control and others just
      omit the subject and leave it to QUIC to handle

3.  Use Cases

   Previously [I-D.draft-rtpfolks-quic-rtp-over-quic] defined several
   key use cases, in addition to several others defined elsewhere.  The
   two use cases that are most applicable today given the existing and
   known future capabilities of QUIC include:

   1.  Unidirectional live stream contribution.  Two immediate scenarios
       that best describe this is firstly users on a streaming platform
       in a remote scenario from their phone live streaming an event or
       going on to an audience in real time in relatively low bitrates
       (~1-5Mbit).  The second scenario is larger bitrate contribution
       feeds in broadcast.  This can be an OB feed "back to base" into
       playout gallery, or from playout facilities to online
       distribution platforms.
   2.  Distribution from platform to audience.  Whilst use of WebRTC or
       RTSP today for On-Demand media streaming is not typical with
       adaptive streaming like HLS and DASH being predominantly used as
       WebRTC is more applicable in latency sensitive contexts such as
       live sporting events.  Instead use cases where there is live
       streaming of TV linear output, or live streaming such as Twitch
       or Facebook, or non-UGC services like OTT offerings made by
       broadcasters.

4.  Requirements

   This section lists requirements for providing real time media
   streaming over a QUIC connection.

4.1.  Codec Agility

   When initiating a media session, both the sender and receiver should
   be able to negotiate the codecs, bitrates and other media details
   based on capabilities and preferences.

4.2.  Flow Directionality

   Media should be able to flow in either direction from client to
   server or vice-versa, either individually or concurrently.

4.3.  WebTransport

   TODO: Unsure if this should be a requirement.  If it is, we have to
   consider two things: WebTransport supports HTTP/2, are we going to
   explicitly exclude it?  Also, WebTransport
   [I-D.draft-ietf-webtrans-overview] has normative language around
   congestion control which may be at odds with our potential
   requirements.

4.4.  Authentication

   The protocol SHOULD have capabilities asides from TLS mutual
   authentication to allow hosts to authenticate one another, this
   should be kept simple but robust in nature to prevent attacks like
   credential brute-forcing.

5.  Non-requirements

   This section covers topics that are explicitly out of scope for the
   time being.

5.1.  Media Transport Protocols

   The creation of new media transport protocols should be avoided, and
   instead we should make use of RTP [RFC3550] and the existing
   ecosystem of payload formats and methods of signalling where
   possible.  It may transpire a need to extend these specificiations;
   in which case we should work with the relevant working groups and
   present our use-cases.

5.2.  Multicast

   Even if multicast and other network broadcasting capabilities are
   used in delivering media in our use cases, as QUIC doesn't yet
   support it and it's inclusion would require a lot more complexity in
   both the specification and client implimentation this should be left
   out for now.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   As this document is intended to create discussion and consensus and
   introduces no security considerations of its own.
